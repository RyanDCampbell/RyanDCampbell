## About Me

Hey there! I'm Ryan Campbell, I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Manitoba who is passionate about technology. 

This GitHub has a few of the projects I have worked on over the years to help me get a better understanding of different topics in Computer Science, such as Object Oriented Programming, Databases, Operating Systems along with some technical writing.

Most of these projects are largely incomplete and will be improved.


### Some of the more complete projects include:

<b> Clue </b> 

This is a command-line Clue game based on the Resident Evil universe where you can play against several computer places to discover the who, what and where of a murder.

<b> Pokedex </b>

This is a command-line Pokedex based on gen 1. Pokemon has always been a huge part of my life, putting hundreds of hours into Pokemon Blue on my Game Boy Colour as a kid. When studying databases, makkng a Pokedex was the first thing to come to mind.
