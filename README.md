Hey there! I'm Ryan Campbell, I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Manitoba. 

This GitHub has a few of the projects I have worked on over the years to help me get a better understanding of Computer Science.

Most of the projects are largely incomplete.

Some of the more complete projects include:
